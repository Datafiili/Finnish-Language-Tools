# Finnish-Language-Tools

Tools to manipulate the Finnish language.

These scripts are written in Finnish and are made to be used with the Finnish language. All of the comments are in Finnish. This project is all about creating tools for the Finnish language, without a library of Finnish words. Take all of the files, because the scripts use each other.

The goal of this package is to create toolset for translation purposes.
