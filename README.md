<h2>Goals:</h2>
<h4>Main goal</h4>
Main goal of this project is to codify Finnish language for automation of learning Finnish and side goal is to create tools translation purposes. Many types of practises could be automatically generated, if program could automatically add cases to list of words. Uralic languages have always been worst enemies of translating into Indo-European languages. Goals of this project could lead to the infinity as languages are very complicated and not all languages have same tools to work with.

<h4>Project spesific goals:</h4>
Many of the goals require other parts to work, so there is no real order that these can be done.
1. Case adding tool: Input a word and case to be used with it output the word in correct form. 
2. Consonant gradiation: Finnish words change their form very easily with consonant gradiation adding, changing, or taking away latters. And of course they have exceptions too.
3. Vowel change: More research on this! My current understanding of this isn't great enought to program it to be consistant.

<h4>Later goals:</h4>
1. Case reading tool: Word is inputted and program returns the baseword and name of the case. This would be one of the most important tool for translating (from Finnish or into Finnish), as it would clarify the words and meanings.
2. Meaning translator: Languages love idioms. They change the meaning of the sentence. Currently I have no idea if this is even possible to do

<h4>Scrapped goals:<h4>
1. Not to use a library of Finnish words. This was originally the idea that was proven to be impossible. Finnish is very logical and has a lot of patters, but there is cases where you need to know the words to manipulate them correctly. Combine words can need a word library in rare cases. Näytönohjain (graphics process card) has a combination of näytön and ohjain, where first word ends with a konsonant and second ends with a vowel. Rules determine that words must be separeted from where words change, so program can't determine that without a library.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<h4>Files in Finnish or English</h4>
Currently project is in a weird hybrid where some files are in Finnish and some are in English. Later on the goal is to convert everthing into one language (or both). Comments can many times be in Finnish, because hole language consepts doesn't even exist in English and because of that, there is many cases where English doesn't have vocabularity for these consepts.
